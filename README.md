# Psychowords  
A smart, feature-rich web app for mastering vocabulary for the Israeli Psychometric exam — designed to help you memorize words in the most effective way possible.

## Motivation  
I took the psychometric exam in March 2021. I had enrolled in one of the big-name prep courses in Israel, but their vocabulary practice tool was disappointing — just a basic four-choice random quiz with no real learning strategy.

So instead of studying (oops), I decided to build my own tool — one that actually helps. As I progressed, new ideas came to mind, and I kept improving the site along the way. What started as a quick side project became a tool I wish I had from day one.

## How It Works

After registering to the site, you can start building your own personal vocabulary collection. For each word, you can add a definition, an example sentence, and even a personal association to help you remember it better.

All the words you enter go into your **personal dictionary**, which you can later organize into custom groups. But you’re not limited to just your own words — you can also explore words added by other users, see their examples and associations, and "like" any entry to add it to your own list.

Once your dictionary is populated, you can start training. The site offers multiple practice modes and customization options to help you focus on exactly the words you want, in the way that works best for you.

All of this is presented through a clean, modern, and well-organized interface — with smooth navigation and no unnecessary page reloads. It’s designed to feel fast, professional, and distraction-free.

The next sections break down each feature in detail.

## Inserting a New Word to the Dictionary

This feature allows you to add new words to your personal dictionary, along with rich information to help with memorization.

For each word, you can provide:
- A definition
- An example sentence
- A personal association or memory aid

You can also explore the most liked definitions, examples, and associations added by other users for the same word — and easily adopt any of them into your own entry.

Words can be organized into custom categories to match your study style. For example, you might create a group like “Words I don’t even know how to pronounce” to revisit later. You’re free to create any categories that help you organize your learning.

At the bottom of the page, you can also view and edit the last 10 words you added, making it easy to refine or update entries on the fly.

## Personal Dictionary

The Personal Dictionary is where all the words you've added are displayed in a clean, easy-to-navigate interface. Each word entry includes your custom definition, example, and personal association — all visible at a glance.

You can also see public content that others have contributed for the same word. If you find a definition, example, or association you like, you can simply "like" it to add it to your own version.

Each word in your dictionary can be assigned a **familiarity level**:
- **Green** – I know this word well  
- **Orange** – I barely know this word  
- **Red** – I don’t know this word  

These labels help you prioritize your study sessions.

You can filter and view your words in various ways:
- All words  
- Words I know  
- Words I barely know  
- Words I don’t know  
- Words from a specific category  
- Words I added  
- Words I liked  

This flexibility gives you full control over what to focus on next.
